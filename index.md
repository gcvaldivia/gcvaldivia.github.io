I am a Ph.D. student in Physics at the University of Houston. My research interests include quantum gravity, quantum information, and condensed matter theory.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Physics from the National University of San Marcos in Peru, where I received a high-quality, tuition-free education, graduated with honors, and achieved the highest academic standing in my cohort. I then earned a Master of Science in High Energy Physics from the esteemed ICTP-EAIFR in Rwanda, thanks to a scholarship from ICTP. During this period, I also had the privilege of participating in and completing the ICTP Postgraduate Diploma Programme in High Energy Physics online.

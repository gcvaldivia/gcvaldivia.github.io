I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Houston, conducting research on quantum foundations, quantum gravity, and their connections with condensed matter and quantum many-body systems using the holographic principle. This approach deepens our understanding of these complex systems and reveals insights into quantum information, entropy, and transport properties in highly correlated systems.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Physics from the National University of San Marcos in Peru, where I received a high-quality, tuition-free education, graduating with honors and achieving the highest academic standing in my cohort. Subsequently, I earned a Master of Science in High Energy Physics from the esteemed ICTP-EAIFR in Rwanda, made possible by a scholarship from ICTP. During this period, I also had the privilege of participating in the ICTP Postgraduate Diploma Programme (online).

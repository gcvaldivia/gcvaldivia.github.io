I am a Ph.D. student in Physics at the University of Houston, with a focus on the research areas of Quantum Foundations, Quantum Gravity, and Quantum Computing. Prior to embarking on my doctoral studies, I obtained an M.Sc. in High Energy Physics from the prestigious ICTP-EAIFR. During this time, I also had the privilege of participating in the ICTP Postgraduate Diploma Programme (online). It is worth noting that my academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Physics from the National University of San Marcos in Peru, where I received a high-quality, tuition-free education, graduated with honors, and achieved the highest academic standing in my class.

I am a Ph.D. student in Physics at the University of Houston, with a focus on the research areas of quantum foundations, quantum gravity, and quantum computing. Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I earned an M.Sc. in High Energy Physics at the prestigious ICTP-EAIFR. During this period, I also had the privilege of taking part in the ICTP Postgraduate Diploma Programme. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Physics from the National University of San Marcos (Peru), where I graduated with honors and achieved the highest academic standing in my class.

I am a Ph.D. student in Physics at the University of Houston, with a focus on the research areas of quantum foundations, quantum gravity, and quantum computing. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed an M.Sc. in High Energy Physics at the prestigious ICTP-EAIFR, during which I also had the opportunity to participate in the ICTP Postgraduate Diploma Programme. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Physics from the National University of San Marcos, where I graduated with honors and achieved the highest academic standing in my class.

1. On the Unruh effect and the Thermofield Double State
   
The goal of this document is to present a pedagogical development of the Unruh effect and the Thermofield Double State. In section 2, we construct the Rindler spacetime and analyze the observer's perspective under constant acceleration in Minkowski, which motivates relating the Fourier modes in both geometries using the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformations. In section 3, we examine the physics involved, which leads us to the Unruh effect. Finally, in section 4, we obtain the Thermofield Double State by performing a Euclidean analysis of the field and geometry.

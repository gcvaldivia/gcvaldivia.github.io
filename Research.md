**(2024) [Path integral derivation of the thermofield double state in causal diamonds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03541){:target="_blank"}:** In this article, we follow the framework given in the article {\it Physica A}, \textbf{158}, pg 58-63 (1989) by R. Laflamme to derive the thermofield double state for a causal diamond using the Euclidean path integral formalism, and subsequently derive the causal diamond temperature. The interpretation of the physical and fictitious system in the thermofield double state arises naturally from the boundary conditions of the fields defined on the Euclidean sections of the cylindrical background geometry $S^{1}_{\beta}\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\beta$ defines the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate and $S^{1}_{\beta}$ is a circumference of length $\beta$. The temperature detected by a static diamond observer at $x=0$ matches with the thermofield double temperature derived via this path integral procedure.

**(2025) [On the Unruh effect and the Thermofield Double State](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09869){:target="_blank"}:** The goal of this document is to present a pedagogical development of the Unruh effect and the Thermofield Double State. In section 2, we construct the Rindler spacetime and analyze the observer's perspective under constant acceleration in Minkowski, which motivates relating the Fourier modes in both geometries using the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformations. In section 3, we examine the physics involved, which leads us to the Unruh effect. Finally, in section 4, we obtain the Thermofield Double State by performing a Euclidean analysis of the field and geometry.

**(2025) [Thermal nature of the causal diamond horizon: A hidden property of the inertial propagator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16880){:target="_blank"}:** Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in \textit{Phys. Rev. D 100, 045024 (2019)}, we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In this method, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Furthermore, we find that the ratio of emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. We then extend the analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a meticulous analysis of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.

**(2025) [HBAR entropy in causal diamond geometry: A near-horizon perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13493){:target="_blank"}:** In this article, we extend the Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) framework, originally introduced by Marlan Scully et al. in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 115, 8131 (2018), to the causal diamond (CD) spacetime. We study a cloud of two-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD, freely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a weak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an emergent conformal symmetry—captured by conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)—governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission process. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D = 1/(\pi\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces the entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that the causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a \emph{topological thermal reservoir}, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global causal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, highlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to the existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole.

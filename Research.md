1. [Anomalous changing of geodesics in hairy black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04800){:target="_blank"}<br />

We study the motion of test particles and the propagation of light around neutral hairy black holes under the influence of a self-interacting real scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. The goal of the present work is to show that the time-like and null-like geodesics have an anomalous behaviour for a special range of parameters in the dense hair region.
